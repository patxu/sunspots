Sunspots are particularly hot regions on the sun. [t/f]
f
Sunspot formation is strongly connected to the sunpots magnetic fields. [t/f]
t
As the temperature of a region on the sun decreases, it should emit more light. [t/f]
f
The Sun's magnetic field is the result of ionized gas. [t/f]
t
We can use absorption line spectra to verify that magnetic fields are present in sunspot areas. [t/f]
t
If one were to block out the surrounding area a sunspot would appear completely dark to the naked eye, just like it appears through a telescope. [t/f]
f
The solar sunspot cycle is an 11 year cycle. [t/f]
t
The sunspots are randomly distributed across the surface of the Sun. [t/f]
f
The distribution of sunspots is closely related to the Sun's differential rotation. [t/f]
t
The Sun's magnetic field remains relatively unchanged over long periods of time. [t/f]
